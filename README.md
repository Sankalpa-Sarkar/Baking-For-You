# Baking-For-You
A WordPress website made using PHP and HTML, implementing the concepts of database management using SQL. Tables were made and the data in the records were referenced according to user input, using basic SQL commands on PHPMyAdmin on a local host. The website is based on Database Management System principles, with multiple tables and records created to store the ingredients for particular baking recipes. Being an experimental project, the confines of the provject are limited to a certain number of ingredients and a certain number of recipes alone. 
Being a prototype of an idea, this can be expanded upon to expand said database with more recipes and more ingredients with the same SQL logic and better SQL normalization to improve loading time. The purpose of the website is for the user to input certain ingredients available at his or her convenience, tallying which the website will throw up the recipes that can be concorted by the user using those recipes. The basic database manipulation technique used here is to search the entire recipes records and identify the closest possible baking recipe which can be concorted. The same is achieved using basic DCL and DML commands.
